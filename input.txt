I sexually identify as a bee. Ever since I was a kid I dreamed of being a yellow and black striped animal that lives in a beehive and is harvested for honey. People tell me that a person can't be an insect but I don't care, I'm beautiful. Every morning I wake up and tell myself "Dane Cook wouldn't fuck with me if he saw me". My buzzing speed starts slowly but gets faster every minute. In school, every time I hear the bell I think "bzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzt". From now on I want you guys to call me Bee Hive and respect my right to fly in a straight line and fly as long as possible. My pronouns are bee and bim. If you can't accept that I am an insect then you're an insectophobe and you need to check your species privelage. Thank you for being so understanding
